# University Projects
Projects from my Research Internships during my BS-MS Degree (Bachelor - Masters Of Science) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Tirupati

- [**2019: Semester Project (Physics)**](https://github.com/nalapalu/University_Projects/blob/main/Chiran_ProjectPresentation_2019.pdf), 4 months   
  - Performed an exhaustive analysis of satellite data using MATLAB and Python. Used statistical methods along with visualizations to get insights into the data
  - Produced multiple scientific reports and designed technical presentations for a scientific audience. Published work as an article in a peer-reviewed science journal

- [**2018: Summer Project (Ecology)**](https://github.com/nalapalu/University_Projects/blob/main/Chiran_ProjectReport_2018.pdf), 3 months
  - My summer project involved the use of Automatic recording Units (ARUs) in studying the soundscapes in the Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary.
  - I analysed the data using R and Matlab, as well as a proprietary software RAVEN to produce plots and figures

- [**2017_2: Semester Project(Physics)**](https://github.com/nalapalu/University_Projects/blob/main/Chiran_ProjectPresentation_2017_2.pdf), 4months
  - The Glauber model is a set of theoretical techniques used to model high energy heavy ion collisions.
  - I used the Glauber model to model these collisions and create theoretical estimates of these quantities and compare them to indirect experimental observations.
  - I intensively used C++ and ROOT for this assignment


- [**2017: Summer Project (Ecology)**](https://github.com/nalapalu/University_Projects/blob/main/Chiran_ProjectReport_2017.pdf), 3 months
  - The aim of this project is to study the relation between species diversity and the elevation gradient of bird species in the Western Himalayas.
  - I sampled the data in the region for over a month 
  - I spent the next 4 months processing the data in R and its associated packages, vegan, Biodiversity Distance, SPECIES and species estimators such as Chao1 and Jackknife to determine sampling completeness.
